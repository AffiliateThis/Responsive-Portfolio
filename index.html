        <p>
          I am Chris Kautz-Scanavy and I am training to become a junior full
          stack developer. I have done quite a few things since graduating
          college amost 19 years ago. After college I moved to Richmond as that
          is where my band was located and Richmond had a good music scene in
          the early 2000's. Playing doesn't pay the bills, so I became a
          beerman. Now that was fun, driving a big ass beer truck with 60 kegs
          plus while selling and delivering them. I mean I was the beerman...
          then my back said, "screw you, your beerman days are over. Time to do
          something else."
        </p>

        <p>
          Afer my "Beerman" days were over, I was a sub-teacher briefly and this
          was while recovering from a back injury and a rebuilt knee. Naturally,
          it was time to do outside MRO sales, nuts bolts, mechanical related
          stuff, and industrial chemicals. Upon further reflection and
          experience, outside sales in the MRO industry didn't seem like a great
          a fit for me. Most of these products could be purchased locally from
          the a hardware store. This is when I decided to join Corporate America
          and work in downtown Richmond doing inside sales for a car dealer lead
          generation company. I eventually made a transition while at the same
          company to the Marketing dept at to manage their lead acquisition and
          generation. Since that point, I have been in the online marketing
          industry for 14 years. That is a long time, and it is now time for me
          to build upon the knowledge and experience I have gainged and really
          grow my professional skillsets and become a full stack developer. Bam!
          Like I dropped a mic, well not really.
